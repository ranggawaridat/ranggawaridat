### about

I study how systems behave when assumptions collapse.  
When networks degrade.  
When control becomes partial.

Silence, for me, is not absence —  
it is a design choice.

---

### focus

- Systems engineering (Go, backend)
- Cloud-native & distributed systems
- Failure-oriented design
- Adversarial & defensive system analysis
- Observability under constraint

---

### notes

- Centralized control fails loudly.  
  Distributed control fails quietly.

- Attack paths are unintentional documentation.

- Resilience is measured *after* recovery — not uptime.

---

### stance

I treat adversarial systems as engineering problems.  
Understanding control structures leads to calmer,
more resilient defensive design.

---

### contact

If you think in failure modes,  
we will understand each other.
